# Simple artificial neural network
Though there are many artificial neural network libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch etc. that can be used to create a NN in a few lines, this exercise is to understand the working of ANN in a very clear manner.


Here we give a 3 predictors  and a dependent variable.
Artificial neural network is a supervised learning algorithm.

The random predictions which are made initially are compared with the 
correct output and the error is calculated. 
The function that finds the differene between the actual value and the predicted value is called the cost function.
We reduce the cost function by adjusting the weights in each epoch.
